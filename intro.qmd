# Introduction

The Introduction page is intended as a short introduction to the book.

Like most Quarto books, this is a book created from markdown and executable code. 

This kind of book is an example of literate programming - the intertwining of nicely-formatted text and images, and executable code. For example, the `R` code cell below executes and produces output when the book is compiled:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

But the `R` code cell below does not:

```{r}
#| eval: false

summary(cars)
```

See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.
