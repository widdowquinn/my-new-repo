# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a Quarto book, generated using the `sipbs-compbiol-book-template` GitHub template.

The `index.qmd` file provides this Preface page, which is intended as a frontispiece with brief introductory information about the book and its contents and scope and, maybe, its authors. To change the main text and content you see here (the content in the middle section of the page), you need to edit the `index.qmd` file.

::: { .callout-tip }
To put links into Quarto pages, use the structure:

```markdown
[Text to be displayed](URL of the link)
```

For example, [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) is written as

```markdown
[this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
```

## How this page is structured

### Section headers

Section headers are written in [Markdown] using hash/pound signs:

```markdown
## This is a (level two) section header.
### This is a (level three) section header
```

- To learn more about sections and headers, see this [quick guide to Markdown basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html). 

::: { .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Changing title and author information, or the cover image (click to expand)
The book title, author, date, and cover image are specified in the `_quarto.yml`. To change this information, edit that file, and re-render the page.

```yaml
book:
  title: "THE TITLE OF THE BOOK"
  author: "AUTHOR NAME"
  date: "DD/MM/YY"
  cover-image: sipbs_compbio_800.png
```

### Callout blocks

Callout blocks, like the ones above, are highlighted regions of the document which carry a title, icon and colour, which may indicate the kind of information the callout contains. For example:

::: { .callout-warning }
This is a warning block. To insert a block like this, use:

```markdown
::: { .callout-warning }
The text of the callout goes here
:::
```
:::

::: { .callout-caution collapse="true" title="Caution (click to expand)"}
This is a caution block, which is collapsible when rendered as HTML/webpage but appears in full in the Word document. To make a callout collapsible, use `collapse="true"` as in the example below. This places a dropdown icon to the right of the title bar, which controls expansion.

```markdown
::: { .callout-caution collapse="true" title="Caution (click to expand)"}
This is a collapsible caution block. The callout content goes here.
:::
```

Notice also that the title of the callout is specified between the curly braces as `title="Caution (click to expand)"`.
