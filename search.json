For this page, the code block\n```{webr-r}\n#| context: setup\n\n# Download reporter data\ndownload.file('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sipbs-compbiol/BM214-Workshop-3/main/assets/data/reporter_curves.csv', 'reporter_curves.csv')\n\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\ndeclares that it has the setup context, so will be run when the WebR instance starts.

The last three lines import R packages into the WebR environment.\n\n\n4.4.3 The WebR code cell\nThe minimal WebR code cell looks like this:\n```{webr-r}\n```\nbut it is more helpful, and more usual, to include some example code or comments, as in the example below:\n\nAppearanceMarkdown\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n```{webr-r}\n# You can use `R` as a calculator\n\n1 * sin(1)\n```",
