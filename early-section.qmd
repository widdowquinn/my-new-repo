# Early Section {#sec-early .unnumbered}

This `.qmd` file introduces a `Part` of the Quarto book. We use the `{#sec-REFERENCE}` option to make it cross-referenceable elsewhere in the text, and the `{.unnumbered}` option to avoid giving it a section number.

We can add custom callout boxes like this: 

::: {.case-study}
This is a custom-styled callout box about bacterial growth (with a title and referenceable id). The custom callout styles can be added in `_quarto.yml`.

You can use it with the `{.case-study}` syntax.
